Comparative Analysis of RFE and LASSO in Predicting Insurance Fraud Using Machine Learning
My project Mainly Focuses on Fraud insurance using machine learning with two feature selection techniques RFE and LASSO. i preprocessed the data and develop three machine learning models for the two features which is XGboost, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. The best model, XGBoost with RFE, achieved a testing accuracy of 87% and a low MSE of 0.13, showing strong capability in detecting fraudulent claims.
